     <br>
     <br>
<p><font color="grey">Terry Fox was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and raised in Port Coquitlam, a community near Vancouver. An active teenager involved in many sports, Terry was only 18 years old when he was diagnosed with osteogenic sarcoma (bone cancer) and forced to have his right leg amputated 15 centimetres (six inches) above the knee in 1977.</p>
<br>

          <p><font color="grey">While in hospital, Terry was so overcome by the suffering of other cancer patients, many of them young children, that he decided to run across Canada to raise money for cancer research. </p>
<br>
          <p><font color="grey">He would call his journey the <span class="w3-tag w3-dark-grey">“Marathon of Hope”</span></p>
<br>
<p><font color="grey">He ran close to 42 kilometres a day through Canada's Atlantic provinces. However, on September 1st, after 143 days and 5,373 kilometres, Terry was forced to stop running outside of Thunder Bay, Ontario because cancer had appeared in his lungs. Terry passed away on June 28, 1981 at the age 22.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="grey">The heroic Canadian was gone, but <span class="w3-tag w3-dark-grey">his legacy was just beginning</span>.</p>
